## Outline

1. Guiding principles
1. Conceptual basis
1. Proposal
1. GBI-OVN

## Why?

* We want to collaborate on researching and implementing our visions;
    * We want this collaboration to be free of constraints on which vision and how we should pursue individually;
    * Yet, our individual work should contribute to the overall vision and draw inspiration / ideas / knowledge from others;
  
* This does not go easy:
    * We have a number of projects (both internally and externally) which revolve around the same ideas yet are somewhat isolated:
        * Challange propagation, chemical organization theory, offer networks, FutureICT, Computing in the Web, Holomidal Collective Intelligence, Ceptr, etc...

## What?

* Combine two kinds of thinking:
    * Conceptual guidance (philosophers, scientists, theoreticians, ...);
    * Unconstrained experimentation (entrepreneurs, hackers, developers, ...);

## Knowledge flows

* We want both conceptual guidance and unconstrained experimentation:

<div class="notes">
- There is loose connection between areas;
- Knowledge flows openly both bottom up and top down;
- Forms 'value chains';
- Chains can be started in any area;
- Some projects / initiatives will not get connected to chains...
</div>

## Challenge

* Create more value via collaboration:
    * Connect the areas without constraining activities within them;
    * Attract people who are doing relevant research for sharing;
* Distribute the created value among participants;
